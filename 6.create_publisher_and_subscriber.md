# Writing a Simple Publisher and Subscriber

Using C++
Copy from ROS WIKI

1. Writing the Publisher Node

1.1 The code
Create a src directory in the beginner_tutorials package directory, this directory will contain any source files for the beginner_tutorials package

Create the src/talker.cpp file and paste the following inside

#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"

#include <sstream>

/**
* This tutorial demonstrates simple sending of messages over the ROS system.
*/
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
/**
* The ros::init() function needs to see argc and argv so that it can perform
* any ROS arguments and name remapping that were provided at the command line.
* For programmatic remappings you can use a different version of init() which takes
* remappings directly, but for most command-line programs, passing argc and argv is
* the easiest way to do it.  The third argument to init() is the name of the node.
*
* You must call one of the versions of ros::init() before using any other
* part of the ROS system.
*/
ros::init(argc, argv, "talker");

/**
* NodeHandle is the main access point to communications with the ROS system.
* The first NodeHandle constructed will fully initialize this node, and the last
* NodeHandle destructed will close down the node.
*/
ros::NodeHandle n;

/**
* The advertise() function is how you tell ROS that you want to
* publish on a given topic name. This invokes a call to the ROS
* master node, which keeps a registry of who is publishing and who
* is subscribing. After this advertise() call is made, the master
* node will notify anyone who is trying to subscribe to this topic name,
* and they will in turn negotiate a peer-to-peer connection with this
* node.  advertise() returns a Publisher object which allows you to
* publish messages on that topic through a call to publish().  Once
* all copies of the returned Publisher object are destroyed, the topic
* will be automatically unadvertised.
*
* The second parameter to advertise() is the size of the message queue
* used for publishing messages.  If messages are published more quickly
* than we can send them, the number here specifies how many messages to
* buffer up before throwing some away.
*/
ros::Publisher chatter_pub = n.advertise<std_msgs::String>("chatter", 1000);

ros::Rate loop_rate(10);
/10HZ

/**
* A count of how many messages we have sent. This is used to create
* a unique string for each message.
*/
int count = 0;
while (ros::ok())
{
/**
* This is a message object. You stuff it with data, and then publish it.
* By default, roscpp will install a SIGINT handler which provides that Ctrl-C  will cause ros::ok() retrun false.
*/
std_msgs::String msg;

std::stringstream ss;
ss << "hello world " << count;
msg.data = ss.str();

ROS_INFO("%s", msg.data.c_str());
/ROS_INFO is the replacement for printf/cout

/**
* The publish() function is how you send messages. The parameter
* is the message object. The type of this object must agree with the type
* given as a template parameter to the advertise<>() call, as was done
* in the constructor above.
*/
chatter_pub.publish(msg);

ros::spinOnce();
/*
*Calling ros::spinOnce() here is not necessary for this simple program, because we are not receiving any callbacks. *However, if you were to add a subscription into this application, and did not have ros::spinOnce() here, your callbacks *would never get called. So, add it for good measure.
*/

loop_rate.sleep();
/to sleep for the time remaining to let us hit the 10Hz publish rate
++count;
}


return 0;
}


Here's the condensed version of what's going on:

Initialize the ROS system
Advertise that we are going to be publishing std_msgs/String messages on the chatter topic to the master

Loop while publishing messages to chatter 10 times a second


2. create a publisher node
Create the listener.cpp file in the same directory, and paste the following inside it

#include "ros/ros.h"
#include "std_msgs/String.h"

/**
* This tutorial demonstrates simple receipt of messages over the ROS system.
*/
void chatterCallback(const std_msgs::String::ConstPtr& msg)
{
ROS_INFO("I heard: [%s]", msg->data.c_str());
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
/**
* The ros::init() function needs to see argc and argv so that it can perform
* any ROS arguments and name remapping that were provided at the command line.
* For programmatic remappings you can use a different version of init() which takes
* remappings directly, but for most command-line programs, passing argc and argv is
* the easiest way to do it.  The third argument to init() is the name of the node.
*
* You must call one of the versions of ros::init() before using any other
* part of the ROS system.
*/
ros::init(argc, argv, "listener");

/**
* NodeHandle is the main access point to communications with the ROS system.
* The first NodeHandle constructed will fully initialize this node, and the last
* NodeHandle destructed will close down the node.
*/
ros::NodeHandle n;

/**
* The subscribe() call is how you tell ROS that you want to receive messages
* on a given topic.  This invokes a call to the ROS
* master node, which keeps a registry of who is publishing and who
* is subscribing.  Messages are passed to a callback function, here
* called chatterCallback.  subscribe() returns a Subscriber object that you
* must hold on to until you want to unsubscribe.  When all copies of the Subscriber
* object go out of scope, this callback will automatically be unsubscribed from
* this topic.
*
* The second parameter to the subscribe() function is the size of the message
* queue.  If messages are arriving faster than they are being processed, this
* is the number of messages that will be buffered up before beginning to throw
* away the oldest ones.
*/
ros::Subscriber sub = n.subscribe("chatter", 1000, chatterCallback);

/**
* ros::spin() will enter a loop, pumping callbacks.  With this version, all
* callbacks will be called from within this thread (the main one).  ros::spin()
* will exit when Ctrl-C is pressed, or the node is shutdown by the master, or the ros::ok() returns false
*/
ros::spin();

return 0;
}


#change the CMakeList.txt

Add the following inside it:

add_executable(talker src/talker.cpp)
target_link_libraries(talker ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(talker beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)

add_executable(listener src/listener.cpp)
target_link_libraries(listener ${catkin_LIBRARIES})
add_dependencies(listener beginner_tutorials_generate_messages_cpp)
//Note that you have to add dependencies for the executable targets to message generation targets

#Finaly, build the node

$ catkin_make

3. Examing the Publisher and Subscriber
