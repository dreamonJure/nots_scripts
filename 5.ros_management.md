# ROS topic management
#To view the computer graph ,firstly ,install the rqt tools

$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt
$ sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-rqt-common-plugins

#run the tool

$ rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph 

#I think simply using " rqt_graph "work as well

#rostopic

#show the data published on a topic

$ rostopic echo [topic]

#show all topic 

$ rostopic list

#show type of the topic

$ rostopic type [topic]

#look details of the mesgs using rosmsg

$ rosmsg show [msg_type]

#or using pipeline

$ rostopic type [topic]|rosmsg show

#then we can publish the msg by manual using 

$ rostopic pub [topic] [msg_type] [args]

#such as I publish the msg of driving the racecar moving by

$ rostopic pub -l /vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/output ackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped -- '[38000,0,"0"]' '[-0.5,0.75,300,0,0.75,0.0]'

#the command publish message only once ,to publish message in specific hz by using -r

$ rostopic pub /vesc/low_level/ackermann_cmd_mux/output ackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped -r 60 -- '[38000,0,"0"]' '[-0.5,0.75,300,0,0.75,0.0]'

##!!!!! If you don't know how to construct the topic, you can use double <tab>, it will construct the msg automatically:

$ rostopic pub [topic_name] [msg_type] [options] <tab><tab>

#see how fast the node is publishing:

$ rostopic hz [topic]

#to plot the topic

$ rosrun rqt_plot rqt_plot

#then typing the topic which you want to plot and press plus button

#using rosservice

#Usage
#rosservice list         print information about active services
#rosservice call         call the service with the provided args
#rosservice type         print service type
#rosservice find         find services by service type
#rosservice uri          print service ROSRPC uri
#######################################################


#use rosservice list to look up all the services, and then use rosservice type to look the type of the service

$ rosservice type [service]

#also can use pipline like this

$ rosservice type [service]|rossrv show

#then we can call the service by using call command and passing args like this

$ rosservice call [service] [args]

#roslaunch
#NOTE:The directory to store launch files doesn't necessarily have to be named launch. In fact you don't even need to #store them in a directory. roslaunch command automatically looks into the passed package and detects available #launch files. However, this is considered good practice.

#rosed command

#usage rosed

$ rosed [pkg_name] [file]

#I don't think it is necessary

#!!!!creating a ROS msg and srv

#msg: simple text file ,describes the fields of a ROS message ,stored in msg directory, just like C-structure; srv file describes a service , #have two parts :a request #and a response ,stored in srv directory.

#a special type in ROS, the header, which contains a timestamp and coordinate frame information

#Here is an example of a msg that use a Header, a string primitive ,and two other msgs:
#################################################
Header header
string child_frame_id
geometry_msgs/PoseWithCovariance pose
geometry_msgs/TwistWithCovariance twist
#################################################

#After create msg file in directory msg/xxx.msg, the package.xml should be inserted with

<build_depend>message_generation</build_depend>
<exec_depend>message_runtime</exec_depend>

#And CMakeLists.txt should be changed as
#add messaged_generation in find_package() function

find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS
roscpp
rospy
std_msgs
message_generation
)


#and export the message runtime dependency in catkin_package() as:
#NOTE: the stand other catkin_depends should be removed
catkin_package(
...
CATKIN_DEPENDS message_runtime ...
...)

#and find the following block of code, to uncomment it and replace the contents

add_message_files(
FILES
xxx.msg
)

#and make sure the generate_messages() function is called by finding the following lines and uncomment ti

generate_messages(
DEPENDENCIES
std_msgs
)


#creating srv

#using roscp to copy a existing one from other package

$ roscp [pkg_name] [file_to_copy_path] [copy_path]

#then to add the message_generation in build_depend and message_runtime in exec_depend in package.xml
#and other things is almost the same as add msg files, except uncomment the add_service_files instead of add_message_files


#After done this ,we have make some new messages
#in the root of the workspace ,execute

$ catkin_make install

#Any .msg file in the msg directory will generate code for use in all supported languages. The C++ message header file #will be generated in ~/catkin_ws/devel/include/beginner_tutorials/. The Python script will be created in #~/catkin_ws/devel/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/beginner_tutorials/msg. The lisp file appears in #~/catkin_ws/devel/share/common-lisp/ros/beginner_tutorials/msg/.
